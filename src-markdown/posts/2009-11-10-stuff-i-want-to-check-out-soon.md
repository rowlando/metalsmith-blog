Over the past few weeks I have come across a number of tools, libraries, etc... that I hope to check out soon.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://spriteme.org/">SpriteMe</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://code.google.com/closure/">Google Closure Tools</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.galan.de/projects/packtag">PackTag</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/12632">FireQuery</a></li>
</ul>
I've noticed Firefox has gotten slower with each new release. I am looking for a replacement development browser and have read today that <a href="http://webkit.org/blog/829/web-inspector-updates/">WebKit's WebInspector</a> has recently been overhauled and seems to be a great alternative to Firebug.
