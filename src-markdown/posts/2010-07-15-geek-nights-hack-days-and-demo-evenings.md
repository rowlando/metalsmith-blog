Last night I attended the <a href="http://southlondon.geeknights.net/2010/07/14/">South London Geek Night</a> in The Bedford and I was impressed by the high calibre speakers. I now know NoSQL is a movement, not a technology, courtesy of <a href="http://hugorodgerbrown.blogspot.com/">Hugo</a> - <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/southlondongeeknights/nosql-what-does-it-mean-how-did-we-get-here-and-why-should-i-care-hugo-rodgerbrown">check out the slides</a>. The talk from <a href="http://makitolabs.com/">Makitó Labs</a> was inspiring. To get the <a href="http://voteforpolicies.org.uk/">Vote For Policies</a> up and running in less than two weeks, whilst holding down a day job and funding it themselves, was a lesson to us all that persistence and hard work in indeed worth it. The lightning talks were brilliant too. I loved the talk on Dynamic Pub Table Configuration Protocol. Hilarious!

A couple of weeks ago I joined in the fun at the inaugural <a href="http://sciencehackday.com/#success">Science Hackday</a> hosted at The Guardian's HQ in Kings Cross. Jen and I made a fun, random comparison generator. We called it <a href="http://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1Rlm80j9oW6HCRI90CRkuxbXBmq0GeO9WFDhJcV4lEL0">How Fast Am I</a> but you can also get comparisons for height, distance and time. Go on, give it a try:

The next geek event I'm off to is the <a href="http://paypalydnlondon.eventbrite.com/">Paypal and Yahoo Developer Challenge demo evening</a>. It's hosted at <a href="http://www.techhub.com/">TechHub</a>, a new venue for tech startups. This will be a good opportunity to have a nosey.
